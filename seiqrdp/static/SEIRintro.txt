<H2>The value of models, even when (especially when) models and observations don’t match – exploring the “SEIR” model</H2>

Over a 30+ year professional career, I came to learn that while mathematical models are often intended to drive decisions, the modeling process itself can be critical in guiding the scientific discovery process.  Benefits of modeling to the discovery process include:  articulating an underlying mechanism, creating a common vocabulary for debating that mechanism, identifying previously non-obvious relationships between “inputs” and “outputs”, declaring and testing assumptions, and often most importantly, identifying and learning from discrepancies vs. observation by directing new questions.  These new questions typically include: 
<ul>
<li>Does the model contain an invalid assumption?</li>
<li>Is there an implicit assumption in the model that wasn’t obvious?</li>  
<li>Does the model not account for an important mechanism?</li> 
<li>Are the observed data used to fit or test the model biased in some way?</li> 
<li>Are the initial starting conditions known?</li>
</ul>
<p>Asking and addressing such questions are invaluable in the discovery process.  Yes, these questions often led to arguments, but generally healthy arguments which ultimately advanced our understanding.</p>
<p>Conversely, acceptance of models (and the guidance they provide) faced resistance when the assumptions were not transparent, the underlying mechanisms weren’t clearly explained, and, when a model invariably didn’t replicate observation, the modeling experts modified the model to improve its apparent fidelity without a satisfactory explanation of what was changed.  The arguments that ensued from these situations were often unhealthy.</p>
<p>In that spirit, I’ve built an interactive graphical application which lets the user adjust the various parameters in the standard “Susceptible-Exposed-Infective-Recovered” model of infectious disease.  Many are familiar with the output of this standard model as seen via the COVID-19 “Flatten the Curve” initiatives.</p>
<p>My intent is to let others play with the model, discover for themselves the relationships between variables, recognize some critical assumptions in the model, and encourage the curiosity to ask more questions.  I've included some of my questions below the graphic.  In my experience, reasonable people of good will can disagree about scientific assumptions and data; debating over these disagreements has been far more productive than debating about one another’s individual agendas and biases.  My intent is NOT to convince others of any preconceived notion I may have, nor to assert whether or not the model accurately reflects the current reality, nor to advocate for this (or another) specific model formulation.</p>   
<p>Lastly, I am not trying to be yet another “amateur epidemiologist”, but I firmly believe that there are learnings from industrial mathematical process modeling that are beneficial in our current environment.</p>
